## 4. Recommended Architecture: Hybrid Approach

After analyzing the requirements and options, the **hybrid approach** is recommended as the optimal solution for the LED Matrix Control System.

### 4.1 Architecture Components

#### 4.1.1 LightBox Components (Edge Computing)
- **Lightweight Local Server:** Node.js with Express (minimized version)
- **Local Database:** SQLite for local state persistence
- **Local MQTT Broker:** Mosquitto (lightweight alternative to EMQX)
- **Firmware Manager:** Handles updates from S3
- **LED Matrix Controller:** Direct hardware interface

#### 4.1.2 Cloud Components (AWS)
- **EC2 Instances:** Node.js with Express for remote access and administration
- **RDS:** PostgreSQL database for user management and analytics
- **ElastiCache:** Redis for performance optimization
- **S3:** Firmware storage and distribution

### 4.2 Key AWS Services Explained

#### 4.2.1 AWS S3 for Firmware
AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides a scalable, secure system for storing and distributing firmware updates:

**Firmware Storage Process:**
1. You upload new firmware versions to S3 buckets
2. Multiple firmware versions can be maintained (current, previous, beta)
3. Access controls ensure only authorized systems access firmware files
4. Metadata stores information about each version

**Firmware Distribution Process:**
1. When a LightBox needs to update, it downloads firmware from S3
2. S3 can handle thousands of simultaneous downloads
3. The update process includes verification and installation
4. Update success/failure is reported back to the backend

**Benefits for Your System:**
- Cost-effective storage (~$0.023/GB/month)
- 99.999999999% durability for firmware files
- Built-in security features
